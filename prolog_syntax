declaration: x is y:

	x(y).

Condition: (x is y) if (a is b):
	
	x(y) :- a(b).  

Disjunction (OR): (x is y) or (a is b):

	x(y);a(b).

Relationship: x has a y relationship with z:

	y(x, z).

	*order does not matter so long as there is consistency.

Variables:

	Anything beginning with an upper case letter:

	X.
	Hello.
	Variable.

Rule:	Simply a statement defined with variables.

	nice(X):- pleasant(X), wellMannered(Y).
	jealous(X, Z):- loves(X, Y), loves(Y, Z).


Prolog Terms: 4 Types
	
	1. Atoms 	- Strings beginning with a
			lower case letter.
		 	- An arbitrary sequence of chars enclosed
			in single quotes.
			- A string of special characters

	2. Numbers	- Not particularly in prolog.

	3. Variables	- Strings beginning with upper case
			letters.

	4. ComplexTerms	- Collections of Constants (Atoms and 
			Numbers) and Varibles.

Unification

- Two terms unify if they are the same term or if they contain variables that can be uniformly instantiated with terms in such a way that the resulting terms are equal.
